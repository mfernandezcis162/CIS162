<p>My name is Matthew Fernandez, I am a CIS 162 student seeking to become educated the field of computer science and related subjects. 
    This course will be my introduction in coding. I am looking to starting a new career in computer science while continuing my current career 
    field in the meantime. I am starting a bit later in life than some of  my peers but am excited at the prospect of learning something new 
    that brings me great interest. I am looking forward to the challenge of taking this course and hope to gain some skills that I can use and expand
    upon in the future</p>
